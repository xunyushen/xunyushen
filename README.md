## Little About Me

I graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 2023 (We Are!!) where I was deeply involved in the machine learning. After graduation, I decided to pursue my Master's degree at Johns Hopkins University(Go Hop!). There, I shifted my focus to deep learnig - compyter vision. Throughout my academic journey and experience in data science and machine learning, my goal is to be an engineer who designs decision-making processes (feedback -> response).

In my past journey, I have acquired a diverse array of tools and techniques through internships and work, some closely tied to data science, while others venture beyond it. I’ve always cherished the learning process itself over the immediate application, believing that the true value lies in cultivating the ability to grasp new tools and wield them effectively. I see myself as a sponge, absorbing every skill and experience, all in preparation for the day I can create something truly remarkable for society.

## Ongoing research

I am leading an ongoing research project on automated detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) diseases. We leverage a unique dataset of clinical patient slides from Johns Hopkins Hospital under special institutional authorization. The dataset includes high-resolution fluorescence images stained with HCHO and ethanol to highlight P-ANCA and C-ANCA patterns. I design a weakly supervised multi-instance learning pipeline that extracts patch-level features using pre-trained ResNet models. I implement top-k patch sampling and attention-based aggregation to handle limited annotations. I integrate segmentation tools such as StarDist2D and Cellpose to isolate relevant cells and improve signal quality. I apply supervised contrastive learning to pre-train the feature extractor on similar datasets. I evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. My aim is to deliver a software tool that automates ANCA pattern detection in clinical workflows. This tool will assist pathologists by providing rapid, reliable screening—reducing workload and diagnostic variability. I plan to release a user-friendly interface and validate it in a Johns Hopkins clinical trial next year.
